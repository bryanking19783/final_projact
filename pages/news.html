     <h1>COVID safe measures</h1>
     <p>COVID safe measures for schools, preschools and children’s centres continue to be reviewed on a regular basis with SA Health.<br/>

     We recognise that every school and preschool is being affected by COVID-19 in different ways and that principals and preschool directors are best placed to make local decisions.<br/>

     Face to face gatherings for staff (such as workshops, conferences and group professional development) should continue to be held online where possible.<br/>
</p>
<h1>Face masks in education settings</h1>
<p>
Face masks in education and care settings (schools, preschools and children’s centres) are strongly recommended (but not required) for:<br/>

all adults (including visitors) while indoors, except when it impedes ability to teach<br/>
students in years 3 to 12 while indoors.
Anyone who is a close contact and is aged 12 years and older will need to wear a mask when they leave the house for 7 days following exposure as per the SA Health close contact guidelines.<br/>

Employees and non-employees who are not fully vaccinated must continue to wear a mask while indoors, at all times as per the COVID-19 vaccination policies (staff login required).</p>
